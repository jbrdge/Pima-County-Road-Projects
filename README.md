# Pima County Road Projects
This project represents exploratory data analysis of publicly available Pima County road project data.  
[Road Repair and Preservation Projects](https://gisopendata.pima.gov/maps/de212931f01f4f6181b21506fd6bcd4a)

## Excel EDA
- I imported .xlsx dataset into excel.
- We can then begin to explore the data. I first looked at the overall number of projects completed per year. Pretty clear that 2022 was the most productive year. Although, this data only reflects until 6/2025, so it may be less than the accurate amount by the end of the year.

I further looked in to the year 2022, we see tha Granite Construction completed the largest amount of projects.
